# PERN TODO APP

## Purpose
I am doing this tutorial in order to better understand how postgres works with Node. I have worked quite a lot personally with Mongo, but due to some personal interest in a business idea that would require an Enterprise level application, I am working to learn how to leverage a relational database to a greater extent than what I have in the past.

## To run the application:
- Install nodemon either globally or as a dependency of the server directory
- Run `npm install` in both the `server` and the `client` directories
- Run `nodemon` in the `server` directory
- Run `npm start` in the `client` directory
